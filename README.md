# Synthetic-Data-Generator

The Synthetic Data Generator is a lightweight tool that creates realistic, customizable datasets for training, testing, and demonstration purposes without exposing sensitive information. By simulating real-world data structures, the tool helps researchers, trainers, and developers practice analysis workflows, prototype dashboards, or showcase tools while protecting respondent confidentiality.

Users can specify parameters such as sample size, variable types, distributions, correlations, and levels of missingness, as well as include realistic identifiers (e.g., names, phone numbers, addresses) using libraries like Faker. The output can be exported in multiple formats (CSV, Excel, Stata, etc.), making it versatile for teaching, testing survey pipelines, or validating analysis code.

This project reduces risks around handling personal data while increasing efficiency in research support, training, and capacity-building activities.
